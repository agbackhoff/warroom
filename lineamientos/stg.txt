1. Staging Model (stg):
   - Configure the model as ephemeral
   - Perform safe casts for each column to it's data type
   - Use the following structure:
     ```sql
     {{ config(materialized="ephemeral") }}

     with stg_[table_name] as (
         select
             {{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['[primary_key_column]']) }} as pk_[table_name],
             [safe cast statements for each column]
         from {{ source('[source_name]','[table_name]') }}
     )

     select * from stg_[table_name]
     ```
- Make sure to add all columns in the SELECT statement and keep the same column names before and after the 'AS' statement
