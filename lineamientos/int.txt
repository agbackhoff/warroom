2. Intermediate Model (int):
   - Configure the model as a ephemeral
   - Perform deduplication using row_number() over the primary key
   - Use the following structure:
     ```sql
     {{ config(materialized="ephemeral") }}

     with de_duplicacion_[table_name] as (
         select
             *,
             row_number() over (
                 partition by pk_[table_name]
                 order by [timestamp_column] desc
             ) as rownum
         from {{ ref('stg__[table_name]') }}
     )
         select
             *
         from de_duplicacion_[table_name]
         where rownum = 1
     ```
